          </div>

          <div className="text-lg">
          Two surveys were designed to collect data on two different areas of interest: the relationship between early childhood experiences and future life satisfaction, and the correlation between primary school success and high school grades.

            &#8226; <span className="font-bold">Correlation Between Primary School Success and High School Grades:</span> the aim is to understand how an individual's success in primary school may influence their performance in high school. By examining experiences during the transition and the perceived impact of primary school success on high school grades, the survey seeks to uncover patterns and trends that may exist in academic trajectories.

          <div className="text-lg ml-6">
            &#8226; <span className="font-bold">Early Childhood Experiences and Satisfaction with Future Life:</span> the aim is to investigate the connection between an individual's happiness with their present circumstances and hopes for the future and their early childhood experiences. The objective is to identify potential relationships between early life and overall life satisfaction by exploring the perceived impact of childhood events, parental influence, and the development of coping strategies.

            &#8226; <span className="font-bold">Correlation Between Primary School Success and High School Grades:</span> the results would provide light on whether performance in elementary school and later high school grades are significantly correlated. Educational methods and support systems may be improved by having a better understanding of the elements that make a transition easy or difficult as well as how they are thought to affect academic success.

            &#8226; <span className="font-bold">Early Childhood Experiences and Satisfaction with Future Life:</span> the aim of the results is to ascertain whether a person's level of life satisfaction and their early experiences are significantly correlated. Talks about children well-being and future life outcomes can benefit from insights about the role of parental influence, the formation of coping strategies, and the general impact of early experiences on life satisfaction.
